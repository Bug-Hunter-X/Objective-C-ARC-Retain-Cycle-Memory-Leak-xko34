In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Consider a scenario where you have a class `MyClass` containing a strong property `myObject` of type `AnotherClass`. If `MyClass` is deallocated, but `myObject` is still strongly referenced elsewhere, a retain cycle occurs. This cycle prevents `myObject` from being deallocated, leading to memory leaks.  The problem is exacerbated if `myObject` itself contains strong references back to `MyClass`, creating a circular dependency.
